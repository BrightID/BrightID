## Unique Human Identity

BrightID allows you to prove to applications that you're only using one account.

* [No personal data or biometrics are used for verification](https://www.brightid.org/faq).
* Verified by a trusted group of close personal contacts plus a [decentralized graph database](#decentralized--nonintrusive).
* [A lost or compromised ID can be replaced by reconnecting with a few close personal contacts](https://medium.com/brightid/brightids-social-recovery-46bc71ce84ae).

### Decentralized & Nonintrusive

The network consists of volunteers [running nodes](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node). Nodes host the social graph used for verification, but there's no personal information stored there.

## Mobile App

ID creation and connections to people and apps are managed through the BrightID mobile app.
